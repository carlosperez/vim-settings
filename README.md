# Designer Inspired Vim Settings

My own designer-inspired vim config. It includes:

- Nunjucks syntax highlighting
- Nerd-tree with a familiar CTRL-K, CTRL-B trigger for Sublime users!
- A not horrific colorscheme
- And some other handy doo-dads

Nods to @CSilivestru and @brentlintner for the help.
